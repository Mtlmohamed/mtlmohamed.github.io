<h4 class="text">The <cyan>Home Assistant</cyan> platform is designed with user-friendliness in mind, making it easy for anyone to set up and use. We will be utilizing a powerful integration called ESPHOME. </h4>
<h3 class="subhead">What's Integration for <cyan>Home Assistant</cyan>?</h3>
<h4 class="text"><cyan>Home Assistant</cyan> Core can be extended with integrations. Each integration is responsible for a specific domain within Home Assistant. Integrations can listen for or trigger events, offer services, and maintain states.</h4>
<img class="HA" src="integration.png">
<h3 class="subhead">What's ESPHOME?</h3>
<h4 class="text">ESPHome (previously known as esphomelib) is a Nabu Casa-owned tool with which you can create custom firmware for readily available and cheap ESP8266 and ESP32 boards. Custom firmware on its own might sound complicated, but ESPHome makes its creation easy.</h4>
<img class="HA" src="esphome.png">
<h3 class="link">The <a href="https://github.com/jcallaghan/home-assistant-config/issues/12"target="_blank">Code</a> can get from this link </h3>
<h3 class="subhead">Functionality</h3>
<h4 class="text">Ensure that your ESPHome device and Raspberry Pi are connected to the same Wi-Fi network, as this is a crucial step for proper functionality.</h4>
<h4 class="text">To ensure proper functionality, it is important to note that the ESPHOME device and the Raspberry Pi must be connected to the same wireless network. In certain cases, such as in a school setting, the provided network may require a unique username in addition to the standard SSID and password. To work around this, a separate router can be utilized to create a distinct wireless network for the ESPHOME device to connect to. This can be done by connecting the router to the existing network via an ethernet cable and configuring the new network with a unique name and password. Once this is done, the ESPHOME device can be connected to the newly created network, allowing for seamless communication with the Raspberry Pi. </h4>
<h4 class="text">To ensure optimal performance, it is important to perform range tests with the ESP8266 and the router. By testing the connection at various distances and with different levels of interference, such as walls, we were able to determine the maximum range of connectivity. With minimal interference, we were able to achieve a range of up to 116 meters, which was quite satisfactory. However, it is important to note that walls and other forms of interference can greatly reduce the connectivity range, so it is important to take them into consideration when setting up the system.</h4>

<h3 class="subhead">Interesting Fact</h3>
<h4 class="text">Once you have successfully configured the <cyan>Home Assistant</cyan> and the Raspberry Pi, you'll find that it is incredibly easy to use. Utilizing the ESPHOME integration, the process of connecting your ESP8266 device to the network is seamless and effortless.
<h4 class="text">Additionally, the range capabilities of this setup are impressive, with the ability to connect up to 116 meters with zero interference. This makes it possible to have multiple ESP devices working simultaneously, providing real-time monitoring and analysis of your home automation system. It's a truly mind-blowing experience to see how quickly and easily the ESP devices connect to the network, making it simple to set up multiple sensors with just a couple of ESPs.</h4>
